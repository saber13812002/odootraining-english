#then create a project folder
#the following are the steps

1. Create an odoo folder in our Home directory
2. Go to the odoo folder then create 3 more folders, namely: addons, source, conf
3. Move the downloaded file (ODOO14) into the odoo folder and extract the file. The zip file can be put in the source folder for archives
4. Go to the extracted folder and rename the folder in it to odoo-14.0. Then remove the folder (cut) to align with source, conf, and addons
5. Enter the odoo-14.0 folder and then enter the setup folder again
6. Copy the odoo file to the same path and rename it to odoo-server
7. Right-click the odoo-server file and select Properties and tick the Allow Execute… checkbox.
8. Move the odoo-server file outside the setup folder
9. Create 3 new folders in the addons folder, namely: TELKOM, ANTAM, and PINDAD
10. Create 3 new files in the conf folder, namely: odoo-telkom.conf, odoo-antam.conf, and odoo-pindad.conf
11. Each of the contents of the conf file as follows:

odoo-telkom.conf
[options]
admin_passwd = superadmin
db_host = False
db_port = False
db_user = odoo
db_password = odoo
addons_path = /home/USER_LAPTOP/odoo/addons/ANTAM

odoo-antam.conf

[options]
admin_passwd = superadmin
db_host = False
db_port = False
db_user = odoo
db_password = odoo
addons_path = /home/USER_LAPTOP/odoo/addons/ANTAM

odoo-pindad.conf

admin_passwd = superadmin
db_host = False
db_port = False
db_user = odoo
db_password = odoo
addons_path = /home/USER_LAPTOP/odoo/addons/PINDAD

Notes :

– Don't forget to use the superadmin password to create a new database.
– The names of the TELKOM, ANTAM, and PINDAD folders indicate the name of the project we are handling.
– The project folder serves to accommodate custom modules that we develop for related projects.
– conf file names: odoo-telkom.conf, odoo-antam.conf, and odoo-pindad.conf following the name of the project folder that we are handling. Please customize
– Please adjust the name USER_LAPTOP with your respective users.
If you are confused, type pwd in the terminal, you will see our laptop user next to the home path.
If on my laptop it will exit /home/dito.
Means my USER_LAPTOP is dito
